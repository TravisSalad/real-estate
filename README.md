Andrea's real estate insight page

Andrea Salad Real Estate
Website planning phase

I have decided to build a web page that will feature real estate information for my wife, Andrea Salad.  I want to make it a simple page that uses Zillow’s API which gives neighborhood/real estate insight so users can look up information on potential neighborhoods they are interested in.  Unfortunately my original plan which was an actual real estate search is not do-able because there is no way to access live MLS data.  Zillow also has other tools I am interested in potentially adding to the site including mortgage rate calculators to give potential buyers more insight into what they can realistically afford.

I also want to make a contact page using JQuery’s .validate() method that will require a full name (letters only) an email address (must contain @ symbol) and a message that is less than 500 characters.  I will use bootstraps form to do so and have the submit button link to hear actual email address.

I plan on using JQuery, Bootstrap, getJson to call on Zillow’s API, as well as javascript to complete the website.
